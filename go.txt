> Go is a compile-based language
> our computer can't understand it as it is.
> We need to compile the code through a compiler that get the source code and translate into a executable file in a lower level language.

> When it comes to languages like python you need to definitely have python installed in the machine in order to run a code.
> But in go (compile based languages) , if the code is already compiled you don't need the language to be installed in order to run the program.

Running a go file -> go run <File name>
> This will compile the go file into a executable binary code and runs that code.
> Then immediately deletes the binary code file after the output is given to us.

Package a go file into a executable binary file -> go build <File name>
> This will compile the code manually.
> The file type will be dependent on the OS
> Win -> .exe (To run the file in terminal -> filename.exe)
> Mac / Linux -> (To run the file in terminal -> ./filename)
